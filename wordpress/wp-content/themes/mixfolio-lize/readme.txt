### Theme Options ###

The Welcome Area contains the following optional items:

    Welcome Area Title
    Welcome Area Message (HTML Allowed)
    Latest Tweet
    Contact Details (HTML Allowed)
    Contact Email Address

If both the Twitter and Contact Details aren’t used, then a full width Welcome Area Title and Welcome Area Message will be shown.


### Custom Background and Header ###

Add a personal touch by uploading a Custom Header Image or by taking advantage of the Custom Background feature.


### Full Width Page Template ###

Mixfolio comes with a full width page template, which means that even if you use sidebars throughout your website you will still be able to display full width page features on an as-needed basis.


### Custom Menus ###

Two custom menus are supported. The Primary Navigation Menu will fall back to a list of pages if it has not been manually configured and saved, while the Secondary Menu—which is shown on the home page underneath the Welcome Area—will only be displayed if it has been manually configured and saved.


### Responsive Design ###

Mixfolio is a responsive theme, adapting to the screen sizes of iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices. Want to see it in action? Grab the corner of your browser window and make the window smaller.


### Featured Images ###

This theme relies heavily on Featured Images. The Featured Image will be featured on the Home and Archive pages.


### Post Formats ###

Five Post Formats are supported by Mixfolio: image, gallery, link, quote, and video. Each post format’s single post view contains a unique style that nicely showcases its respective post format.
